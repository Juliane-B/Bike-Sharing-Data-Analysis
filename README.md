FordGoBike Data Analysis by using Python

## Introduction
Ford GoBike is the Bay Area's bike share system. Bay Area Bike Share was introduced in 2013 as a pilot program for the region, with 700 bikes and 70 stations across San Francisco and San Jose. Once expansion is complete, Ford GoBike will grow to 7,000 bikes across San Francisco, the East Bay and San Jose.
Ford GoBike, like other bike share systems, consists of a fleet of specially designed, sturdy and durable bikes that are locked into a network of docking stations throughout the city. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system, making them ideal for one-way trips. People use bike share to commute to work or school, run errands, get to appointments or social engagements and more. It's a fun, convenient and affordable way to get around.
The bikes are available for use 24 hours/day, 7 days/week, 365 days/year and riders have access to all bikes in the network when they become a member or purchase a pass.

## Data Structure
The Data Structure are as follows: Each trip is anonymized and includes:
- Trip Duration (seconds)
- Start Time and Date
-End Time and Date
- Start Station ID
- Start Station Name
- Start Station Latitude
- Start Station Longitude
- End Station ID
- End Station Name
- End Station Latitude
- End Station Longitude
- Bike ID
- User Type (Subscriber or Customer – “Subscriber” = Member or “Customer” = Casual)
- Member Year of Birth
- Member Gender

# Research Questions
1. When are most trips taken in terms of weekday, and time of the day?
2. How long are the trips taken?
3. Are there differences in bike usage between the two customer types (member and casual)?

# Key Findings
- Saturdays and Sundays seem to be the most popular weekdays for using the bike sharing service. This shows that the bike sharing service is particularly used for weekend activities.

- Most bike rides have a duration between 5 to 10 minutes. 

casual users:
- are more likely to rent the Ford GoBike bikes for a longer timeperiod throughout every day of the week
- are more likely to rent the bikes the longest on Saturdays
- have used more electric bikes than docked bikes for short trips
- have used more docked bikes than electric bikes for longer trips
- may rent the Ford GoBike bikes even longer than one day on Saturdays and Sundays
